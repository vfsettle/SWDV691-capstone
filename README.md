# What's in My Pantry? Application
# The  “What’s in My Pantry?” app is a productivity application which offers a way for users to avoid the inconvenience of stocking out of important items and helps reduce expenses of overbuying duplicate or excess items. 
# The app helps users track “inventory” of grocery and household supply items easily forgotten because they are stored “out of sight”. For example, Items stored in the deeper reaches of a freezer, pantry shelf, or garage, tend to be harder to recall from memory as time moves further from the date of purchase or storage. 
# With the “What’s in My Pantry” app, users create their starting inventory by logging names of grocery or household items, labeling storage locations, quantities and expiry dates, if applicable. Users will be able to create new items, define locations, review/search inventory and edit or delete quantities as items are added or consumed.
